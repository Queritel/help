Almost everybody has regular expenses that come back every month, quarter or year. In Queritel Finance, you can register such expenses as "bills".

When you create bills, Queritel Finance will report on the expected amount of bills for each period of time. Queritel Finance uses rules to match transactions to bills. This way you can match your expenses to the bills you have (yet) to pay.
 
In short, you can create a bill for "rent" or for "insurance" and every month, Queritel Finance will show you if you paid for it.
